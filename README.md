Welcome to my repository, featuring all the foundational projects I've completed while learning about NLP and LLMs. 

I've honed my skills by diving into blogs and documentation, and I'll be including those references as well. 

"The learning curve is steep, but the view from the top is worth it." 

Hope this is useful, enjoy exploring my journey, with a touch of my individuality in the code.
